FIFA 22 Player Stats Visualization
This project contains an interactive file (fifa22stats.ipynb) showcasing visualizations and statistical analysis of the FIFA 22 player dataset. The visualizations include bar charts, scatter plots, and other graphical insights into player attributes such as pace, shooting, passing, dribbling, defense, and physicality. It aims to help users better understand player distributions and comparisons in FIFA 22.

Statistical Analysis
The dataset was analyzed using various statistical techniques:
Mean: The average value for wages and market value was calculated to assess overall trends.
Median: The middle value was identified to understand distribution asymmetry.
Mode: The most frequently occurring wage and market value were determined.
Variance & Standard Deviation: Used to measure spread in wages and market values.
Coefficient of Variation:Helps compare the relative variation in wages and market values.
Skewness: Assesses whether the distribution is symmetrical or biased towards higher/lower values.
Kurtosis: Determines if the dataset has heavy tails or follows a normal distribution.
